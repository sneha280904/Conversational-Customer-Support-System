# Conversational Customer Support System

This project is a conversational AI-based customer support chatbot designed to respond to user queries using natural language understanding. It leverages a large language model (LLM) to provide accurate and helpful responses tailored to a specific domain.

## Project Objectives

- Build a conversational interface for customer support
- Fine-tune and integrate an LLM to respond to FAQs and queries
- Enhance user experience with real-time, context-aware answers
- Use microservices and modular architecture for scalability

## Key Features

- Accepts user queries through a web-based interface
- Uses LLaMA or Gemini model for natural language understanding
- Responds based only on provided or fine-tuned domain-specific data
- Collects user information before query processing (optional)
- Supports self-learning by caching new QA pairs

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (microservices structure)
- Streamlit (UI interface)
- Ollama / Gemini / Zephyr AI for LLM
- JSON for dataset management
